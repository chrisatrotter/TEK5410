Assignment 4.1 - GAMS modelling

For the first task, continue the model development we did during the course. Design your own scenario and implement it in our model.

Our initial model is the baseline
How does your proposed scenario change the cost-optimal energy system design?
What conclusions can you draw based on the results?


Assignment 4.2 - Design a research question

Design a research question for the research report. One of the learning objectives is that you should be able to build your own electricity system model in GAMS.

The research question
should reflect your focus with the model and what you want to analyse,
should be motivated
The project
should be related to a specific country and
can be a first step for a master thesis
As this will be an important part of your research projects, we will include a brief discussion with everyone at the lecture to also provide feedback and possible adjustments, if necessary.


Research Question:
How does the optimal deployment and operation of battery energy storage systems affect renewable integration and total system costs in Germany’s electricity system by 2035?

Motivation:
Germany is at the forefront of the European energy transition, with rapidly increasing shares of wind and solar power and a growing need for system flexibility. By mid-2025, the country had installed over 22 GWh of stationary battery storage capacity, yet the optimal scale and operation of storage to support future renewable expansion remain uncertain. Battery energy storage systems (BESS), particularly lithium-ion technologies, are still relatively new in large-scale deployment but are expected to play a central role in decarbonizing power systems across Europe.

This project will develop an optimization-based electricity system model in GAMS to determine the cost-optimal deployment and dispatch of battery storage in Germany by 2035. In addition, an overview analysis of battery storage deployment across European countries will be conducted to provide context on the current landscape, identify regional trends, and position Germany’s storage development within the wider European framework. The results will offer insights into how BESS can enhance renewable integration, reduce system costs, and support a reliable, low-carbon electricity system. This work can also serve as a foundation for a Master’s thesis focused on the role of energy storage in Europe’s energy transition.
