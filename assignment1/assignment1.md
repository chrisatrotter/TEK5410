## Part 1: Current and future Energy systems
**1. Choose a country: Norway**

**2. Describe its current energy system:**

Norway’s energy system is among the cleanest in the world, with generation overwhelmingly renewable and dominated by hydropower. Hydropower typically supplies 88–90% of annual electricity generation, while wind power has grown rapidly in recent years and now provides a small but rising share. Together, these resources make Norway’s grid one of the lowest-carbon electricity systems globally [1,2].

Unlike most European countries, Norway’s main energy and climate challenge does not lie in its domestic electricity production, but in its fossil fuel sector. Oil and gas extraction is the largest single contributor to national greenhouse gas emissions, alongside industry and transport [3,4]. This creates a paradox, Norway consumes relatively clean electricity at home, but remains a major exporter of fossil fuels abroad.

The national energy balance underscores this paradox. Norway produces over 2,400–2,600 TWh of primary energy annually, yet only around 180–220 TWh of electricity is used domestically [7]. Most of the country’s primary energy is exported in the form of crude oil and natural gas. Within domestic electricity use, industry (33–40%) and households (25–30%) are consistently the largest consumers, while transport has grown fivefold since 1990, reflecting Norway’s world-leading electric vehicle adoption [7].

Policy and technology efforts therefore focus Carbon management and new energy vectors by implementing flagship carbon capture and storage projects such as Longship/Northern Lights [5,6], piloting hydrogen and ammonia production, and expanding offshore wind to diversify renewable generation.

Together, these efforts aim to preserve Norway’s clean domestic electricity system while addressing the much larger emissions tied to its oil and gas sector. The transition path is therefore shaped by both domestic energy use efficiency and the international implications of fossil fuel exports.


### 3. Download the NDC: https://unfccc.int/NDCREG and discuss:

#### Does the document specify the methodology for deriving their NDC?
Yes — but only partly.

Accounting methods are spelled out very clearly. The annex specifies that Norway will use the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (with the 2019 Refinement, the KP and Wetlands supplements) and AR5 GWPs (or later, if CMA agrees). The base year is 1990, with reported emissions at ~51.35 MtCO₂e (without LULUCF). Final accounting toward the target will take place in 2037/2038 once the full inventory is available.

Target-setting / modelling methods are much less transparent in the NDC itself. The text explains the target was developed through (i) interministerial modelling and feasibility assessments, (ii) a government proposal with public hearings, and (iii) parliamentary debate leading to its inclusion in the Climate Change Act (see Section 4 of the annex). However, the document does not present the detailed modelling assumptions — e.g. technology costs, carbon prices, or sector-specific pathways. Those are in supporting documents such as the 2035 Climate White Paper (Meld. St. 25 2024–2025) and future Biennial Transparency Reports.

The reporting/accounting rules are well defined, but the underlying analytical pathway that led to “70–75% by 2035” is only sketched, not published in the NDC itself.

#### What are the most important actions to decarbonise energy generation?
Norway’s NDC for 2035 commits to reducing emissions by 70–75% from 1990 levels, and achieving this target will require decisive action in energy generation. The first priority is to keep electricity zero-carbon while meeting rising demand, through offshore wind expansion, selective onshore wind, stronger interconnections, and flexible use of hydropower as the backbone of the system. The biggest challenge lies in the oil and gas sector, where electrifying offshore platforms, cutting methane leakage, and applying CCS (via Longship and Northern Lights) are essential, since production emissions make up a large share of Norway’s total [5,6]. Scaling CCS to industrial scale is also necessary to capture residual emissions in hard-to-abate sectors. Finally, electrifying demand in transport, heating, and industry ensures that clean power displaces fossil fuels. Together, these measures align with Norway’s NDC and are central to reaching its legally binding 2035 climate target.


#### How do you assess the ambition of the NDC (i.e. is it in line with meeting the Paris Agreement-check e.g. climate change tracker: https://climateactiontracker.org/)?
Norway’s 2035 NDC targets a 70–75% reduction in emissions compared to 1990, framed as “fair and ambitious” and informed by the global stocktake, with accounting following CMA guidance and national inventory data. Climate Action Tracker (CAT) has not yet issued a full assessment of the 2035 NDC, but historically rated Norway’s 2030 target (55% reduction) as roughly consistent with strong 1.5 °C pathways, while long-term 2050 ambitions were seen as “average” due to the lack of a formal net-zero commitment.

The 2035 target is ambitious compared with other developed countries and exceeds the average global reductions suggested by the first global stocktake. If reductions are implemented mostly domestically and achieved through real-world measures such as CCS, electrification, and methane mitigation, the NDC could align with a 1.5 °C trajectory. However, the credibility depends on: whether reductions are domestic rather than via international credits (ITMOs), how LULUCF removals are accounted for, how Norway manages ongoing oil and gas production, and the pace of actual technology deployment. On paper, the target is consistent with high-income country responsibilities under Paris, but full alignment depends on implementation and accounting choices, and CAT’s formal rating is still pending.

#### Does the country have a net-zero target ?
No. Norway has a long-term target of a 90–95% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 1990, enshrined in law, aiming for a low-emission society [13]. However, it has not formally committed to a strict “net-zero by 2050” target with clear rules for residual emissions and removals. Climate Action Tracker notes this and rates the 2050 pledge as “Average.” Claims of “net-zero by 2030” in some analyses are aspirational or sector-specific; the official long-term target remains the 90–95% reduction by 2050.

and identify the

### motivation
The study is motivated by the need to transition to a highly renewable power system in Great Britain, where onshore wind is both abundant and cost-effective. However, deployment of onshore wind is often limited by public opposition, mainly due to its visual impact on scenic landscapes. Policymakers therefore need to understand how these social constraints could affect the design, capacity, and costs of a low-carbon energy system. The paper aims to quantify the trade-offs between social acceptance, system design, and cost.

### research question(s)
The main research questions are: How does public sensitivity to the visual impact of onshore wind influence the potential capacity, system configuration, and costs of a highly renewable power system in Great Britain? And, what are the implications for energy policy if highly scenic areas are excluded from onshore wind development?

### methodology
The authors collected empirical data on scenicness from the Scenic-or-Not dataset, which classifies landscapes across Great Britain based on public perception. They then developed three scenarios representing low, moderate, and high sensitivity to visual impacts. These scenarios were used to define constraints on onshore wind siting, which were incorporated into a long-term, cost-optimizing power system model. The model was then used to evaluate differences in installed capacity, spatial deployment, and system costs under varying levels of renewable energy penetration.

### novelty
The study is novel in that it explicitly integrates empirically derived social constraints into a power system optimization framework. Unlike prior work that focuses purely on technical or economic factors, this paper grounds its analysis in public perception data, creating a link between social acceptance and system-level cost implications. It provides a quantitative framework for incorporating public concerns into energy planning, which is a relatively new approach in energy systems modeling.

### results
The analysis shows that onshore wind potential could be reduced by as much as 89% under high scenicness sensitivity. To compensate, the system relies more on offshore wind, solar PV, batteries, and CCGT-CCS, which reduces technological and spatial diversity. System costs, measured by the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), increase by 2–6% under moderate sensitivity and 7.5–14.2% under high sensitivity for 90–95% renewable penetration. The most cost-effective onshore wind sites, particularly in Scotland and South-West England, coincide with highly scenic areas, highlighting a trade-off between cost efficiency and public acceptance.

### Conclusions
The study concludes that public sensitivity to the visual impact of onshore wind can significantly affect the cost and configuration of a highly renewable power system. Achieving low-cost decarbonization without community support is likely to be difficult. Policymakers should consider design improvements, careful siting, and participatory planning to balance landscape protection, energy costs, and social acceptance. The paper emphasizes that integrating public perceptions into energy planning is crucial for a just and inclusive transition.

### Limitations/Future Research
The study acknowledges several limitations. Interconnection with Europe is restricted to current and planned capacities, and demand-side flexibility is not considered. Technologies like CCS are included without social constraints, and scenicness is treated as a binary variable, ignoring population weighting or intensity of concern. Additionally, other factors influencing public acceptance, such as fairness, noise, or flicker, are not modeled. Future research could expand the analysis to include demand response, multi-dimensional social acceptance factors, stakeholder participation in planning, and more refined measures of scenicness.
